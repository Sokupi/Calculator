Hello, this is my 6th project and one that I was thinking about without getting much help in creating one.
This is a standard calculator that we all use but as primitive as it can be. If you wanna try creating one yourself,
here are the steps:

1. Define the Objectives:

    The calculator should take two numbers as input from the user.
    The calculator should ask the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
    The calculator should perform the chosen operation and display the result.
    The calculator should handle invalid inputs gracefully.

2. Plan the Structure:

    Input: Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
    Operation: Ask the user to choose an operation.
    Calculation: Perform the operation based on the user's choice.
    Output: Display the result of the calculation.

3. Implement the Calculator:

    Use input functions to get user input.
    Use if, elif, and else statements to handle different operations.
    Perform calculations using basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).
    Print the result.


I wish you goodluck! ^^
